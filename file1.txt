DONT WASTE TIME
-   eat your frog
-   dont be overwhelmed by small task that doesnt give much influence
-   dont start project you cant finish
-   dont do things that wont be used
-   focus on end picture, and do the most important things first
-   focus
-   add if you can make it fast make it fast, but start it slow if you cant
